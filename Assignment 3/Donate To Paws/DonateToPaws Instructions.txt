The first $150 has a flat fee of $3. (any donation up to $150 has a flat fee of $3)
Donations over $150 (but under $1500) have a fee of 4% or $8, whichever is higher.
Donations of $1,500 (but under $15,000) and over have a fee of 1% or $20, whichever is higher.
Donations of $15,000 and over are subject to (fees as follows):
The first $15,000 have a fee of 1%
The next $4,000 have an additional fee of 2%
Anything more will demand an additional fee of 3%
For example, a donations of $40,000 would be subject to $860 fee: 1% on the first $15,000 ($150 fee), 2% on the next $4,000 ($80 fee), 
and 3% on the last $21,000 ($630 tax).
